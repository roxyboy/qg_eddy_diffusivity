QG eddy diffusivity
===================

A repository for Jupyter notebooks analyzing the eddy diffusivity tensor using 101 quasi-geostrophic (QG) ensemble members with micro initial conditions.

The corresponding manuscript is `"Cautionary tales from the mesoscale eddy diffusivity tensor" <>`_ submitted to Ocean Modelling.
