QG eddy diffusivity
===================

A repository for Jupyter notebooks analyzing the eddy diffusivity tensor using 101 quasi-geostrophic (QG) ensemble members with micro initial conditions.

The corresponding manuscript is `Cautionary tales from the mesoscale eddy diffusivity tensor <https://doi.org/10.31223/X5CW62>`_ submitted to Ocean Modelling.
