QG eddy diffusivity
===================

A repository for Jupyter notebooks analyzing the eddy diffusivity tensor using 101 quasi-geostrophic (QG) ensemble members with micro initial conditions.

The corresponding manuscript is `Cautionary tales from the mesoscale eddy diffusivity tensor <https://doi.org/10.31223/X5CW62>`_ submitted to Ocean Modelling.

The tensor and the eddy flux reconstruction are computed in `LinearRegression <https://github.com/roxyboy/qg_eddy_diffusivity/blob/master/LinearRegression.ipynb>`_, the eigenvalues of the symmetrical component of the tensor in `Sym-eigen <https://github.com/roxyboy/qg_eddy_diffusivity/blob/master/Sym-eigen.ipynb>`_, and their temporal characteristics in `Temporal-Charac <https://github.com/roxyboy/qg_eddy_diffusivity/blob/master/Temporal-Charac.ipynb>`.
The ensemble conversion is examined in `Ens-conv <https://github.com/roxyboy/qg_eddy_diffusivity/blob/master/Ens-conv.ipynb>`_
